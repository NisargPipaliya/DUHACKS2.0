# Duhacks
Project for DUHACKS 2021
Here is the project made by me and my team during the hackathon of DUHACKS
this includes HTML,CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP AND MYSQL.
Here we used PHP for backend purpose and for making connection with database which was made on XAMPP using PHPmyADMIN.

The website is base on an idea to provide a platform to investors and fundraisers by making their profiles on the site and investing 
in their respective interest (for investor) or for raising funds for their idea or startup by letting people know their idea, thier qualification and their vision.

this website is made by team of four people consisting of :
Nisarg Pipaliya(IT)
Disha Modi(CE)
Kevin Sangani(IT)
Mandar Parekh(CE)
